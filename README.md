# Sentiment Analysis on Product Reviews using LLMs

This project explores multi-label sentiment classification on product reviews using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) like LLAMA, GPT, and BERT. Built using Python and notebook-based workflows, the goal is to analyze real-world review text and classify nuanced sentiments using transformer-based models and NLP techniques.

## Key Features

- Preprocessing of real-world review datasets for multi-label classification
- Fine-tuning and evaluation of LLMs including LLAMA, GPT, and BERT
- Implementation of tokenization, attention masking, and embeddings
- Model evaluation using accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrices
- Notebook-based implementation for experimentation and visualization

## Tools & Libraries

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Hugging Face Transformers
- LLAMA, GPT, BERT models
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for plots

## Use Case

Brands and retailers can use this system to:
- Detect nuanced sentiment beyond just positive/negative (e.g., angry, confused, impressed)
- Improve customer service response systems
- Feed clean data into product teams for iterative feedback

## Future Enhancements

- Extend to multilingual review datasets
- Integrate with a Streamlit dashboard for live prediction demo
- Add explainability using SHAP or attention heatmaps
